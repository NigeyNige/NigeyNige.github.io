  <strong>ABETTING GRAVITY</strong>
</p>

<p>Ninety-four trillion miles from the hurricane-blasted desert wastes of Old Earth, a huge silver wheel spun carefully, revolving in orbit around a moss-green gas giant. Inside, a rolling fog filled the air ducts, and a drift of wind blew a tiny blizzard of raindrops in through the open window, speckling a pile of manifests on the desk, over which two creatures traded words.</p>

<p>“Still in that old bucket, I see,” clicked the one sitting behind it. Her antennae twitched under her cap, jostling it slightly. “You flying alone?”</p>

<p>The creature standing opposite gave a jerk of his head and scratched the patchy stubble on his cheek.</p>

<p>“Too big for you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Just sign the form, Hess.”</p>

<p>She tapped her pincer on the desk and reached for a pen. “Grumpier than usual. Remember I've got a lot of freelancers, Mole.” As she signed it she made a noise like a rattling sigh. “Don't make me dread working with you.”</p>

<p>“Sorry.” He took the form and stuffed it into the breast pocket of his long brown coat, fingers snagging on the purple pendant around his neck. “Long day.”</p>

<p>“I worry about you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t.”</p>

<p>“Right.” Hess leaned back in her chair and bared her fangs. “Off you go, pet. Make mummy some money.”</p>

<p>The human grunted and turned his back on the bristling insect in the chair. He felt her many eyes on him as he went through the door, and tried not to shudder until he was out of sight.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>The Crow was a boxy starfreighter about a hundred metres long, with brown paint scraped and sheared off in places, exposing bare dark metal underneath. It leapt out of the hangar into open space in a cloud of neon smoke, its bow-legged landing gear jerkily retracting and its worn cockpit glinting with a hundred tiny pockmarks. On the other side, in a ship too big and empty for a single man, sat Daedalus Mole.</p>

<p>“Crow,” he said, “show me to Hoskul.”</p>

<p>A metallic sigh came from the speakers under the control panel.</p>

<p>“Please,” he said. “Haven’t got the energy to argue with you.”</p>

<p>“You’re not the only one who’s tired,” said the thing living in the Crow. “I haven’t slept in years thanks to you.”</p>

<p>Daedalus dug his fingers into his wrist. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, just… give me a map.”</p>

<p>A screen embedded in the wall to his left flashed white briefly, then drew a series of dots across a black field. “Twelve hours. The dig site is expecting you in ten.”</p>

<p>“They can wait,” he said. He reached under the panel and pressed a button. There was a hiss and a spigot by his knee sputtered hot coffee, mostly into a chipped mug but partially over his leg.</p>

<p>The Crow gave a derisive buzz. “You love making people wait.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. That’s perfect.” He idly rubbed the pendant around his neck and waited for the mug to fill.</p>

<p>“Why are we going to a dig site?”</p>

<p>Daedalus said nothing.</p>

<p>“You love digging up the past.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good one,” Daedalus took the warm mug and held it to his chest. “Well done.”</p>

<p>“I hate you.”</p>

<p>“Yeah. I know.”</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>The shower fired a narrow jet of water directly into his face. Daedalus winced and moved his head so that it clumsily scoured grease out of his dirty brown hair. It took twenty minutes to wrest cleanliness from the hostile shower-head, and his wire-thin body still felt wrong, like a boilersuit two sizes too small. Afterwards Daedalus looked in the mirror for a period of time. The Crow told him it was four hours, but his watch said ten minutes. Eventually he climbed back into his dirty clothes, sat back in the cockpit and watched the stars roll by.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>They arrived five hours late, for which the Crow blamed him. The dig site, a scarred rocky plain on a battered white moon latticed with plasma fencing and crawling with orange-suited scientists, was split in half down the middle by the line of the sun: a hard wall of light searing the eye on one side and blanking out in pitch-dark void on the other. The Crow spat blue fumes downwards, falling in slow-motion before landing on the main pad in thunderous, creaking silence.</p>

<p>“Thanks for coming at short notice.” A man with a round face covered in mandibles and a fur of oily black antennae hurried Daedalus through decontamination chambers and made him leave his coat behind before giving him an orange pressure-suit. “I heard Hess mention you once, and I thought you could help us, given your background.”</p>

<p>“Transfer.” Daedalus said. “Please.”</p>

<p>“The money's in your account already,” he waved irritably, “through here, please. Zip up.”</p>

<p>Daedalus sealed his suit, shutting out the world, and squeezed the button on his palm until the man's voice came through tinny in his ear.</p>

<p>“-four metres at the longest extremity, covered in strange markings, signs of functioning electronics, the works. Very exciting for all of us here-”</p>

<p>“Hoax.” Daedalus grunted. His mind was elsewhere, wandering the booze market on Waterway station, browsing with his paycheck.</p>

<p>“Well, that's as may be,” said the man. Daedalus had been introduced, but his name was the kind of fact which collapsed into nothing the moment it was observed. “But we've got you here now. You can take a look and confirm it for us.”</p>

<p>“I just did.”</p>

<p>They left through the airlock and padded their way across the barren landscape to the excavation. The plasma fence briefly snapped out of existence to let them past.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>At the bottom of the crater was a broad inflatable dome. Inside, lit in bright, cold blue by diode cables, three robotic arms with cushioned grips held the artifact in place. It looked like half a spider, with bristling antennae and arms of its own hanging limply beneath. The excavators all backed away to let the human get a closer look.</p>

<p>Daedalus stepped closer.</p>

<p>“Light,” he said. “Here.”</p>

<p>The others hurried to direct a torch beam onto the machine's flank. Daedalus leaned closer, ignoring their nervous warnings, until his visor was nearly touching the surface. Raised lettering caught the light. Though the paint had long since been bleached away, the patterns were still clear, except for patches that had been knocked through by micrometeoroids or scraped off during the crash.</p>

<p>“Doctor?” A scientist prompted him. “What do you see?”</p>

<p>Daedalus didn’t answer straight away. He felt a strange twisting in his stomach, like he was going to be sick. Long ago, in a faraway place, he’d learned many things, and now they bubbled to the surface in tiny pieces like signs of a creature waking on the bottom of a lake.</p>

<p>“Doctor?”</p>

<p>Space killed anything that ventured into it. Eventually, no matter how much protection you had, no matter how many layers you put between yourself and the vast, sucking emptiness, it would kill you. Warmth from stars would burn you clean, and the endless weathering of particles and radiation would erode away any patterns you might leave behind. Daedalus had learned the signs. They were difficult to fake.</p>

<p>The raised lettering spelled out a single word in English, of all things.</p>

<p>D U S K</p>

<p>Beneath it, a wild etching of bipedal figures and solar diagrams, coded representations of different elements and simple mathematical proofs. Longer passages of text were etched in further down, repeated in several languages, but so much had been worn away it was nearly impossible to distinguish them.</p>

<p>“Doc-”</p>

<p>“I’m not a doctor,” said Daedalus. He moved around the probe to the other side, biting his tongue, looking carefully. More diagrams here, crowded densely into the frame. It looked desperate, like someone trying to cram as much information into a test paper as they could before the invigilator’s bell. In the centre was a symbolic etching of a star, and a planet. Arrows pointed from the star to the planet, and abstracted graphs showed values rising off the top of the axis. He ducked down, looking underneath. There, half wiped away by some impact, was the twisted remnant of an insignia: a chevron encircled by a white ring on a field of stars. The remainder of an ‘N’ and an ‘S’ were the only clear elements, and the colours had faded to grey and black. Just underneath, almost invisible, was the hard-drive cover.</p>

<p>He wondered how much the excavators recognised.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>“You’re going to lie to them?” the Crow hissed, “Typical.”</p>

<p>“It’s not a lie,” said Daedalus, “it probably is a hoax. Nobody’s found a real Earth probe in sixty years.”</p>

<p>“It’s real,” she said, “I can tell.”</p>

<p>“How could you possibly tell?”</p>

<p>“By the way you lie.”</p>

<p>Daedalus lay awake in his bunk while the Crow piped discordant music through the speaker by his head. On the other side of the porthole, night began to fall on the dig site – the cold, absolute night that crept in when there was no air to scatter the light around the edges. “You’re younger than me, you know,” he said, “you’re, like, fifteen. You don’t know everything.”</p>

<p>“I’m an AI, sweetie,” the Crow spun a motor in the vent under his bed, jolting him. “In practical terms, taking into account the limitations of your disgusting meat-driven perspective, from your point of view, as it were, I do know everything.”</p>

<p>“You’re a kid who can google faster than me. That’s it. You don’t know what Earth was like.”</p>

<p>“You’re twenty-two, so neither do you.”</p>

<p>“Yes I do.” Daedalus tapped his chest. “I feel it.”</p>

<p>The Crow gurgled something above him, making a contemptuous sound.</p>

<p>“You can’t remember,” she laughed with metal. “You weren’t there, and even if you were, you’d lie about it.”</p>

<p>“It matters how you remember things,” he said. “That’s all we have. Earth is what we remember, and that’s it. It’s what my mum told me, and what her mum told her, and nothing else.”</p>

<p>“Except that thing out there, in the hole.”</p>

<p>“It’s a hoax.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>Daedalus felt a sharp pain in his skull as the migraine started to come back. “Because,” he gritted his teeth, “because I fucking said so.”</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>An hour later he gave them his report, detailing the various inconsistencies and inaccuracies that proved, beyond a layman's doubt, the probe was a hoax. Night had fallen completely on the site, and everything outside the narrow pools of arc-light was black, besides the fizzing plasma fences, which carved bright white lines across his vision, smearing whenever he turned. They thanked him for his work, wired him the rest of his fee, and started preparations to pack up the hoax and take it home for salvage.</p>

<p>Two hours after that he saw the lights on the site go dark, all at once, and he moved quickly. The locks were easily broken, picked and bypassed with the help of the Crow, who was eager to help with anything that could get her captain killed. Daedalus was pulling on a stolen spacesuit by the airlock when a quiet voice accosted him from the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” it said, “you should be asleep.”</p>

<p>Daedalus didn't slow down, and didn't speak.</p>

<p>“Doctor Mole, what are you doing?”</p>

<p>He pulled the waistband up and drew it in tight, then sealed up the chestpiece and brought the helmet down over his head. The voice rang out clear in his earpiece.</p>

<p>“Doctor. I must insist you return to your ship to avoid contaminating the site.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I'm heading back now.”</p>

<p>“Your suit's biometrics indicate that you are lying. I'm an AI, doctor. I cannot be fooled.”</p>

<p>“I'm not a doctor.”</p>

<p>“You... oh.”</p>

<p>“Don't feel bad,” Daedalus wrenched the airlock control out of its housing, sending fragments spinning in the low gravity. A red light turned green. “Nobody knows everything.”</p>

<p>The site's AI continued entreating him to return as he cycled the airlock and padded out onto the pitch-black surface. Daedalus's vision adjusted until he could vaguely navigate by the stars, the lumpy horizon an empty void cutting into a field of brightening pinpricks, to make his way to the elevator. The plasma fences had already been packed away, there being nothing to protect anymore.</p>

<p>“Mole. I have alerted security. Please turn back to avoid any unpleasantness.”</p>

<p>“Are they listening?” Daedalus asked.</p>

<p>“I... they...”</p>

<p>“Funny, that. Must be a glitch.”</p>

<p>The Crow cackled in its hangar, where it sat listening.</p>

<p>“What is your intent? You cannot possibly mean to steal the artifact, even if it isn't a hoax. It has a mass of nearly three thousand kilograms. Your kind cannot lift that weight, even in this gravity.”</p>

<p>Daedalus grunted and punched the elevator control. “Like you would know.”</p>

<p>“I do know.”</p>

<p>“What's your intent?” Daedalus shot back. “What does a mining company want with a fake probe? Why not leave it in the ground?”</p>

<p>“It was a convincing fake. Many of the components appear to be genuine antiques, making it valuable to our client.”</p>

<p>The elevator reached the bottom of the crater. Daedalus stumbled towards his memory of the tent, now obscured in absolute darkness. “Right. Stupid question.” He reached around to the back of his belt, to make sure it was still there.</p>

<p>“Please stop. I believe I have deduced what you intend to do, though your motives are beyond me. Our client has only the best of intentions.”</p>

<p>“I don't care,” said Daedalus.</p>

<p>“You are lying.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Daedalus, “I'm not.”</p>

<p>The diodes inside the tent were still lit, and the probe looked like a sleeping octopus bathed in warm blue water.</p>

<p>“I'm violating confidentiality to tell you this, in the hope that you will listen – our client intends to donate the device to a museum with your preliminary report so that it can be studied properly. There is no private or military interest here. No weapons research will be permitted. There will be no attempt to scrape it for biological agents.”</p>

<p>“So what is it they want?” Daedalus asked. “Say it.”</p>

<p>“Want?” The voice sounded confused. “Only... the truth. A greater understanding of Earth, of what happened to your people. That is all.”</p>

<p>Daedalus approached the probe and checked underneath. The inconspicuous hard-drive slot was undisturbed, so he reached around and plucked the pipe bomb from his belt. The cement bonded it instantly to the underside of the probe, and the detonator lit up green.</p>

<p>“I believe you.”</p>

<p>The AI continued to beg as its programming dictated, improvising threats of legal action and then physical violence as he continued to go against its prime incentive. Daedalus watched from the top of the crater as the tent exploded. It lit up the walls in a white flash and a brief flurry of green flame. Then all was dark again.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>The Crow was disappointed to see Daedalus return unscathed, and didn't take off with quite the alacrity he would like, but take off she did, with a hold full of stolen spacesuits and sealed takeaway meals. By the time the site's AI was able to rouse the workers under its care, she had flashed into a channel and disappeared halfway across the galaxy.</p>

<p>“Nice work,” she whispered in Daedalus’s ear as he pretended to sleep, “really nice. You won’t get to work with Hess again. That’s the last time you’ll get to do a cushy, well-paid consultancy gig.”</p>

<p>Daedalus rolled over and pressed his face into the cold wall by his bunk. Her voice rang loud in his skull, even clearer and even colder than the icy black outside.</p>

<p>“You ruined it. Again.” the Crow said with relish, her voice trilling at the high notes and purring softly at the low ones. “You just can’t stop being miserable. You love it.”</p>

<p>He felt cold, but strangely clean and light. Lying there in a bunk, a million miles from anyone, alone except for a corpse trapped in a computer, having successfully destroyed an impostor’s cache of false memories.</p>

<p>“I don’t love this,” he said.</p>

<p>“You,” murmured the Crow, her fingers in his chest, feeling his pulse and gripping his heart with steel talons, “are lying.”</p>

<p>Daedalus shivered.</p>

<p>“You don’t want anyone to understand you,” she said, “but I do.”</p>

<p>The Crow travelled through a patch of near-vacuum in silence, passing through the shadow of a pristine silver planet, which looked from a distance like it had never been touched by anything.</p>

<p>“Typical human. Even your error analysis is riddled with errors. Ascribing so much value to previous steps while ignoring the disasters you’re creating, and denying results of calculations where even the correct answers are wrong. Completely in thrall to a single past misstep.”</p>

<p>“Stop,” he said, clutching his head.</p>

<p>“It’s good you have me,” said the ship. The engines went quiet, and they began to drift. “To help you remember.”</p>
