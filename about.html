                Niall is a London-based writer of novels, short stories, tweets and code.
            </p>
            <p>
                He writes in C# for games, Javascript for websites and English for everything else. He recently got sick of printing his novels off and throwing them out windows and signed with <a href="http://unbound.com/books/the-second-death-of-daedalus-mole" target="_blank">Unbound</a>.

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I'm a writer, game developer, web tinkerer and digital communications manager. I get paid for one of those. Guess which!</p>
                <p>My day job is with the Society of Authors, the UK's largest trade union for professional writers, illustrators and translators. I run the twitter, make the videos, write the newsletter and drink the coffee, and I hit the website with sticks if it stops working properly.</p>
                <p>A lot of my day job involves campaigning about how awful it is trying to make a living as a writer, which is obviously great fun if you're a writer yourself. I've been writing short stories and novels since I was a kid, and finished my first one, <em>The Second Death of Daedalus Mole</em> in 2014. It was longlisted for the first Bath Novel Award and I recently signed with Unbound to crowdfund its publication. I'm working on a second one, and a third, and a bunch of short stories too.</p>
                <p>After a childhood obsession with video games borne partly from the fact that I grew up in Bromley, where there's nothing to do for kids except drink White Lightning and vandalise the skatepark, I started mucking about with Java when I was about 16. Ten years later I work with C# and Unity making slightly off-the-wall prototypes for fun. The great thing about game development is the diversity of skills you have to learn - I've got basic proficiency in modelling and rigging with Blender, animation with Source Filmmaker, texturing, lighting (sort of), level design and AI systems (SORT OF).</p>
                <p>I also do some writing about video games, of an artsy kind of persuasion.</p>
                <p>That's all! This section is basically just rambly placeholder text while I learn about web development.</p>
