                Niall is a London-based writer of novels, short stories, tweets and code.
            </p>
            <p>
                He writes in C# for games, Javascript for websites and English for everything else. He recently got sick of printing his novels off and throwing them out windows and signed with <a href="http://unbound.com/books/the-second-death-of-daedalus-mole" target="_blank">Unbound</a>.

                <h2>Novels</h2>
                <p>My first novel, <em>The Second Death of Daedalus Mole</em>, is currently being crowdfunded for publication with Unbound. They're basically a normal publisher, but they fund books in advance through pre-orders (or 'pledges') and then split the profits 50-50 with the author.</p>
                <p>It's a space opera set in our own galaxy a few hundred years in the future. It was longlisted for the inaugural Bath Novel Award. <a href="http://unbound.com/books/the-second-death-of-daedalus-mole" target="_blank">Find out more</a>.</p>
                
                <p>My second novel is top secret, but it's another space opera set some time earlier, and it's about a piece of stolen artwork that has dangerous implications.</p>

                <h2>Journalism</h2>
                <p>Much of my writing education came from writing for blogs and news sites about games. I used to write free pieces for Bitmob (including one of the first ever long-form articles on Minecraft!) as well as more artsy essays for The Clockwork Manual when I was a tiny baby man.</p>
                <p>I have some new pieces brewing, expect to see some here in the near future.</p>

                <h2>Short stories</h2>
                <p>I've written a bunch of short stories over the years. Most have a Sci-Fi bent or supernatural elements, but some are just a bit weird.</p>
