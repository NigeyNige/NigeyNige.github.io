                    He writes in C# for games, Javascript for websites and English for everything else. He recently got sick of printing his novels off and throwing them out windows and signed with <a href="http://unbound.com/books/the-second-death-of-daedalus-mole" target="_blank">Unbound</a>.

                    <h2>The Second Death of Daedalus Mole</h2>
                    <p>My debut novel is currently being crowdfunded with Unbound!</p>
                    <blockquote>“I don’t do that anymore.”<br />
    “Really?” Ellen frowned. “Don’t tell me Daedalus Mole has grown a conscience.”<br />
    “There was nothing wrong with it,” he said. “I just don’t do it anymore.”</blockquote>
                    <p><em>The Second Death of Daedalus Mole</em> is a star-hopping misadventure about scars, self-destruction, healing and loneliness, as well as the flawed ways in which we view those closest to us.</p>
                    <p>It’s also a novel about bar fights and space battles, so there’s something for everyone, really. <a href="http://unbound.com/books/the-second-death-of-daedalus-mole" target="_blank">Become a supporter</a></p>

                    <p>My second novel is still a work in progress.</p>
                    <blockquote>Air burst from the airlock in a cloud of dust and dirt, flinging everything inside outside like a shot 
    from a sling, including two astronauts, facing backwards, holding between them a man in his underwear. They closed the gap in seconds. Shaw stood, feet apart, watching them move. The three drifted slowly apart as they cannoned across empty space, growing larger, fast, as Shaw inched left, then right, arms raised.</blockquote>
                    <p>My second novel follows a shipping crew who have had an extraordinarily bad year, and are just about to quit when they stumble on a priceless artwork from Old Earth. <a href="http://unbound.com/books/the-second-death-of-daedalus-mole" target="_blank">Join the mailing list for updates</a>.</p>

                    <p>It's 1.30pm and I'm still hungover. Last night I joined seven other authors in a secret dungeon beneath Waterstones Gower Street and had five minutes to pitch my book to a room of about four million people, which is obviously fine and not the kind of thing that scares me at all. Luckily everyone was super nice and laughed at the right times.</p>
                    
                    <p>Everyone who attended was given a sweet discount code to use when pledging on their favourite book of the night. If you were there, <a href="https://unbound.com/books/the-second-death-of-daedalus-mole/">don't forget to use it!</a></p>
